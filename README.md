# gscale 2.0
|ðŸ›‘ gscale 2.0 is currently heavy in development. Because things are changing fast, I am currently not accepting any contributions until version 2.0 is ready for production!|
|-|

This is a vue rewrite for gscale currently running with a customized vite setup. In the future I'm hoping on using nuxt when static pre-rendering and other vital features are functional.

## TODO
- Finish up /build/x page
- Image component with png fallback
- Finish up /builds page
- Header
- Footer
- Look into pre-rendering the index page (nice to have)

## Planned new features
### Planned to release on launch
- +3 compensation for talents
- integration with hoyolab map
- auto check for common, book and gem
	- no need for calculator just type in what items you have from your inventory and gscale will check how much you need to craft, if you have enough and will automatically check off materials
- advanced checklist ui per item to fit all of that new stuff
	- could be an extra button next to "Edit" leading to a planner page

### Planned to release after launch
- weapons (heavily seperated from characters, probably everything in a different tab)
- level templates [#22](https://github.com/glaciyan/gscale/issues/22)
- reorder your builds with drag and drop
